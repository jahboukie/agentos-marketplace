# AgentOS Meta-Development CLI

🚀 **Recursive Intelligence Amplification** - Using AgentOS to build AgentOS

## Overview

This lightweight npm package enables meta-development: using AgentOS's own capabilities (memory, execution, learning) to build the AgentOS SaaS platform with confidence-based development.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agentos-dev
```

## Usage

### Initialize Meta-Development Environment
```bash
agentos-dev init
```

### Develop with Confidence Scoring
```bash
agentos-dev develop "Create REST API endpoint for memory search"
agentos-dev develop "Build React component for code execution" --context ui
```

### View Development Memories
```bash
agentos-dev memory
```

### Check System Status
```bash
agentos-dev status
```

## Meta-Development Workflow

1. **🔮 Task Analysis**: AgentOS predicts success probability
2. **💻 Code Generation**: Memory-enhanced code generation
3. **🧪 Sandbox Testing**: Execute code in safe environment
4. **🎯 Confidence Check**: Only proceed if confidence > 85%
5. **📁 File Writing**: Write verified code to files
6. **🧠 Learning**: Learn from outcomes to improve future development

## Features

- **Confidence-Based Development**: Only write code with high confidence scores
- **Sandbox-First Approach**: Test all code before file modification
- **Memory-Enhanced Context**: Use AgentOS memory for better code generation
- **Learning Amplification**: Each development action improves the system
- **Recursive Intelligence**: AgentOS builds better versions of itself

## Philosophy

> "The best way to build an AI system is to use that AI system to build itself"

This meta-development approach creates a feedback loop of continuous improvement, where AgentOS gets smarter about building software by building itself.
